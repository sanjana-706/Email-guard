The goal of this project is to classify emails into spam or ham categories using a machine learning model. The emails are vectorized using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), and the classification is done using machine learning algorithms like SVM (Support Vector Machine) and Random Forest.
Load the dataset and run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to preprocess the data and train the classifier
